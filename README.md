# Project-Autofrettage-of-spherical-pressure-vessel
Autofrettage is a common process of producing residual stresses in the wall of usually thick-walled pressure vessels prior to use. An appropriate pressure, large enough to cause yielding within the wall, is applied to the inner surface of the vessel and then removed. Large-scale yielding occurs in the autofrettaged thick-walled pressure vessel wall. Upon the release of this pressure, a compressive residual circumferential stress is developed to a certain radial depth  at the bore. These residual stresses serve to reduce the tensile stresses developed as a result of subsequent application of an operating pressure, thus increasing the load-bearing capacity of the vessel.

Spherical pressure vessels are commonly used for extremely high-pressure applications because the spherical shape is the most efficient for retaining pressure. Compared to other pressure vessel shapes, a spherical pressure vessel induces the lowest amount of stress on the pressure vessel walls. Additionally, due to the even distribution of stresses in the pressure vessel shell, there are fewer weak points in a spherical pressure vessel than in other shapes. This does not, however, mean that it is the cheapest type of pressure vessel; to the contrary- spherical pressure vessels are often the most expensive to manufacture. That is why they are only used in high-stress applications where there is a notable advantage in reducing the wall stress in the vessel.
