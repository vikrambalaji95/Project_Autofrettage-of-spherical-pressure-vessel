# Project-Autofrettage-of-spherical-pressure-vessel
Autofrettage is a common process of producing residual stresses in the wall of usually thick-walled pressure vessels prior to use. An appropriate pressure, large enough to cause yielding within the wall, is applied to the inner wall of the vessel and then removed. Large-scale  yielding occurs in the autofrettaged thick-walled pressure vessel wall. Upon the release of this pressure, a compressive residual circumferential stress is developed to a certain radial depth  at the bore. These residual stresses serve to reduce the tensile stresses developed as a result of subsequent application of an operating pressure, thus increasing the load-bearing capacity of the vessel.
